    Now, each time a user levels up 50 levels, they will receive a guaranteed oil as reward.

    LV 50/100/150... >> Oil as reward, including the usual gold and chests

  "300.24b_2020-03-05": |-
    Pickaxes V,X and XV are considered to be milestones, so they will become unbreakable for the sake of player progression.
